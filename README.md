# zaJava-Trips

## Overview
Our application was aimed to study and gain hands-on experience in using Spring with Java. Its basic functionality is planning trips in selected cities step by step from first to destination point. You can adjust radius of searching and the highest rated places are being displayed. To get a full picture of how the application works, it is best to try it out!

This project is a **Java Spring Boot** application that integrates **PostgreSQL** for data storage and displays a map using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** on the frontend. The focus of the project is on the backend development, utilizing **Spring Data JPA**, repository pattern, and Spring beans for managing the application's logic and database operations. It demonstrate development of **RESTful** web service with standard **CRUD** operations. It also employs **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code and **Maven** for dependency management and build automation. 

In the future, users' login function is going to be added.
